[Information Commissioner’s updated response to the Data (Use and Access) (DUA) Bill – House of Commons | ICO](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/the-data-use-and-access-dua-bill/information-commissioner-s-updated-response-to-the-data-use-and-access-dua-bill-house-of-commons/)

[Data (Use and Access) Act 2025](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2025/18/enacted)

DUAA received Royal Assent on 19 June 2025 and it includes:

- provisions to enable growth of digital verification services
- new Smart Data schemes
- new National Underground Asset Register
- new changes to the UK's data protection and privacy legislation

DUAA won't be replacing the UK GDPR, DPA 2018 or the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. It will only make some changes to them to make rules simpler for organisations, encourage more innovation and allows responsible data-sharing while maintaining high data protection standard.

### Key changes:

#### 1. Definitions of Scientific Research

Scientific research is now defined as: “Any research that can reasonably be described as scientific and that is conducted in the public interest, whether publicly or privately funded and whether carried out as a commercial or non-commercial activity.”

The new definition helps organisations understand when they can rely on research-related provisions. It also reduces ambiguity, making it easier to justify data processing for research. And it encourages responsible data use that can lead to social and economic benefits.

However not all research qualifies, as it must be reasonably scientific and in the public interest. This may exclude some commercial or internal R&D projects that don't clearly serve a public interest.

Moreover, the debate in Parliament focused on AI development and whether it should be allowed under research provisions. Rather than banning AI-related research, Parliament chose to filter it through the public interest lens.

What this means for Cybercy:  
- Ensure clients understand that not all research qualifies under the new definition. Help them assess whether their research meets he public interest threshold.  
- Stay alert for upcoming ICO publications that define 'public interest' in practical terms.  
- Align our own data processing and compliance frameworks with the new definition.  
- If we work with AI developers, help them document and justify the public interest of their research.

#### 2. Duties to protect children

During the House of Lords stage, the DUA Bill was amended to strengthen protection for children's personal data. Amendments to Article 25(1) of UK GDPR for services likely to be accessed by children.

The ICO must now have regard to the fact that "Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data". This aligns with the Recital 38 of UK GDPR, reinforcing the principle in UK law.

Controllers must consider "higher protection matters" when designing services likely to be accessed by children. These matters include:  
- how children can best be protected and supported when using the services  
- the fact that children may be less aware of risks, consequences and rights related to data processing. They also have different needs at different ages and developmental stages.

Now there are clearer expectations for organisations designing child-accessible services. This change reinforces the importance of age-appropriate design and data minimisation. And it aligns with the Age Appropriate Design Code (AADC), giving organisations a practical framework.

This applies to organisations providing information society services likely to be accessed by children. These organisations must consider higher protection matters under Article 25(1).

However this does not apply to Article 25(2) (Data Protection by Default), although the ICO suggests this is a missed opportunity. The ICO believes 'by default' flows 'by design' and that default settings are crucial for data minimisation.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Help our clients assess and implement technical and organisational measures that reflect children's needs.
- Ensure clients understand that the AADC provides guidance, not a higher legal standard.
- Encourage clients to consider age-specific risks and development needs in product/service design
- Stay updated on any clarifications from government regarding "higher protection matters"
- For organisation not covered by AADC, help them determine case-by-case whether higher protection matters should be considered.

#### 3. Subject Access Requests (SARs)

The DUAA reaffirms the one-month time limit for responding to SARs. However, it introduces a "stop the clock" mechanism:

- if an organisation needs additional information from the requester to identify the data or verify identity, it can pause the countdown.
- the clock resumes once the necessary information is received.

Example: A SAR is received on 1 July. On 5 July, the organisation asks for clarification. The requester responds on 10 July. The one-month countdown resumes from 10 July, not 5 July.

Organisations are now explicitly required to conduct reasonable and proportionate searches when responding to SARs. This means that you don't need to search every system or archive if it's disproportionate to the request. You can limit the scope based on the nature of the request, the volume of data and the likelihood that relevant data exists in certain systems.

The DUAA aims to balance individuals' rights with the operational burden on organisations. This is especially helpful for organisations with large volumes of data and requests that are broad and vague.

The ICO is updating its SAR guidance to reflect DUAA changes. So the ICO encourages organisations to do the following:

- engage early with requests to clarify scope
- use filters (e.g. data ranges, document types) to narrow searches
- document their search strategy and rationale for any exclusions

What this means for Cybercy:

- Incorporating the "stop the clock rule" into our workflows and train staff to pause and resume timeless correctly.
- Help clients define what constitutes a reasonable search. Provide templates or tools for scoping and documenting SAR responses.
- Review SAR Templates and Policies. Ensure request acknowledgement letters include requests for clarification where needed. Include clear explanations of any limitations applied to the search.
- Stay aligned with evolving best practices and legal interpretations (we're good at that)

#### 4. Direct marketing - soft opt in

The DUAA amends the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) to extend the "soft opt in" rule to charities. Previously this exemption applied only to commercial organisations.

Under PECR, organisations can send unsolicited marketing emails or texts to individuals without prior consent if:

- The individual’s contact details were obtained during a sale or negotiation of a sale.
- The marketing is for similar products or services.
- The individual is given a clear opportunity to opt out, both at the time of data collection and in every subsequent message.

The DUAA now allows charities to use the soft opt-in if the individual has supported the charity's cause (e.g. through a donation) or the individual has expressed interest in the charity's purposes. This means charities can send email or SMS marketing to these individuals without explicit prior consent, provided they offer an opt-out.

The ICO supports this change, noting it will help charities better engage with supporters. However, the ICO stresses that charities must still comply with UK GDPR, especially around lawful basis and transparency. If relying on legitimate interest, they must conduct a balancing test to ensure the marketing does not override individuals' rights.

The soft opt-in does NOT apply universally. It may be inappropriate in sensitive contexts, such as if someone uses a crisis service, sending them marketing could cause distress or harm. The ICO urges careful implementation, especially where the relationship with the individual is vulnerable or sensitive. The individual's expectations of contact are limited or unclear.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Help clients determine when the soft-in applies and ensure they offer clear opt-out mechanisms.
- Conduct Legitimate Interests Assessments (LIAs) to support clients in documenting their balancing tests. Highlight scenario where soft opt-in should not be used.
- Ensure clients reflect on the new legal basis for marketing and clarify how individuals can object or withdraw.
- Educate staff on the limits of the soft opt-in. Emphasise the importance of context and sensitivity.

#### 5. Codes of Practice

The DUAA introduces new provisions and clarifications around the development, approval and use of Codes of Practice in the UK data protection framework. These aim to strengthen the role of statutory codes in guiding compliance, clarify the legal status and expectations around these codes. And also support innovation and sector-specific guidance.

The DUAA allows for the creation of supplementary codes to support specific frameworks, such as the Digital Verification Services (DVS) Trust Framework.  
These codes can provide detailed operational guidance, be sector-specific or function-specific, and also be withdrawn or revised by the Secretary of State.

The ICO retains its power to issue statutory codes of practice under the Data Protection Act 2018. The DUAA reinforces that these codes are not legally binding, but they are highly persuasive in enforcement and legal proceedings.  
The ICO is expected to update existing codes and develop new ones to reflect DUAA changes.

The Secretary of State has enhanced powers to approve or reject codes, require the ICO or other bodies to develop or revise codes, and ensure codes align with broader policy objectives.

Codes of Practice serve as a compliance benchmark. Following a code can demonstrate that an organisation is meeting its legal obligations. Departing from a code may require strong justification. The DUAA encourages the use of codes to clarify complex areas of law (e.g. AI, children’s data, digital ID) and support innovation while maintaining safeguards.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Monitoring the ICO and government for new codes issued under DUAA. Pay attention to sector-specific guidance (e.g. for charities, tech, health).
- Use codes as baseline standards for client audits and policy development.
- Help clients align with codes to mitigate enforcement risk.
- Clarify that codes are not optional in practice, they carry regulatory weight. And explain how codes can simplify compliance and reduce legal uncertainty.

#### 6. Automated decision making

The DUAA 2025 reforms the rules around how organisations can use automated decision-making; that is, decisions made without meaningful human involvement when processing personal data.

Previously, under UK GDPR Article 22, organisations could only make significant automated decisions (e.g. affecting legal rights or similarly important matters) if:  
- It was necessary for a contract,  
- Authorised by law, or  
- Based on explicit consent.  
Under the DUAA, organisations may now also rely on legitimate interests as a lawful basis, if appropriate safeguards are in place. The Lawful Bases have expanded.

However, even with the expanded lawful bases, organisations must:  
- Provide meaningful information about the logic involved.  
- Offer the right to human intervention, contest the decision, and express their point of view.  
- Ensure transparency and fairness in how decisions are made.

Under the DUAA, Special Category Data is still restricted. The new flexibility does not apply to special category data (such as health, race, religion, sexual orientation). These types of data remain subject to stricter protections and explicit consent is still required for automated decisions involving them.

The ICO supports the change as a way to enable innovation, especially in areas like AI-driven services, personalised digital experiences and automated eligibility assessments. However, the ICO emphasises that organisations must not misuse legitimate interests to bypass safeguards. They must conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where appropriate. The rights of individuals must remain central, especially where decisions have legal or significant effects.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Clients need to be informed that they can now use legitimate interests for automated decisions but only with appropriate safeguards.
- Ensure that DPIAs include assessments of automated decision-making risks and mitigation strategies.
- Train clients on transparency requirements, help them clearly explain automated processes clearly in privacy notices and user interfaces.
- Make sure systems are auditable, explainable and challengeable by users.
- Also make sure clients understand that explicit consent is still required for automated decisions involving sensitive data.

#### 7. recognised legitimate interests

This change affects how organisations can rely on the legitimate interests lawful basis under Article 6(1)(f) of the UK GDPR.

1. **Pre-Approved Legitimate Interests**

The DUAA creates a list of specific purposes that are now considered “recognised legitimate interests.” When processing personal data for one of these purposes, organisations do not need to conduct a balancing test (i.e. weighing their interests against the individual’s rights and freedoms). But they can rely on the legitimate interests lawful basis more easily and confidently.

2. **Examples of Recognised Legitimate Interests**

- The list includes purposes such as:
    - Detecting, preventing, or investigating crime
    - Safeguarding national security
    - Ensuring network and information security
    - Protecting the public from dishonesty, malpractice, or other seriously improper conduct
    - Responding to emergencies or threats to public health

> This list is **limited** and defined in legislation. It does **not** apply to all types of processing.

The ICO supports this change as a way to reduce administrative burden for organisations, as well as to provide greater legal certainty in common, low-risk scenarios. However, the ICO emphasises that organisations must still meet transparency and accountability obligations. This change does not remove the need to consider individuals’ rights, especially in sensitive contexts.

**What This Does _Not_ Change**

For non-recognised legitimate interests, the usual balancing test still applies. This change does not override other data protection principles (e.g. data minimisation, purpose limitation). And it does not apply to special category data unless another lawful basis is also met.

What this means for Cybercy:

- We have to update the client guidance to help clients identify when they can rely on recognised legitimate interests. As well as clarify when a balancing test is still required.
- Ensure clients clearly explain their lawful basis, including when they're using a recognised legitimate interest.
- Educate stuff on the difference between recognised and general legitimate interests. Provide examples and decision-making tools.
- Monitor for updates regarding the list of recognised legitimate interests.

#### 8. international data transfers

The DUAA 2025 introduces clarifications and streamlining to the rules governing international transfers of personal data from the UK to other countries. These changes aim to simplify compliance for organisations as well as support international trade and innovation and maintain strong protections for individuals’ data when it leaves the UK.

The DUAA restructures and simplifies the legal provisions around international transfers. It retains the core principles of UK GDPR but makes the rules easier to navigate.

There's a few transfer mechanisms that will remain:

- Adequacy regulations (i.e. countries deemed to have adequate protection)
- Appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) and codes of conduct and certification mechanisms.

The DUAA confirms that organisations can take a risk-based approach when assessing international transfers. This means that you can consider the likelihood and severity of harm to individuals and you are not required to assume worst-case scenarios in every case. This is a significant shift from the strict interpretation of the CJEU's Schrems II ruling, which required detailed assessments of foreign surveillance laws.

The ICO will continue to approve new transfer tools such as updated SCCs, as well as provide guidance on risk assessments and transfer impact assessments (TIAs). The ICO will also monitor developments in international data protection standards.

The ICO supports the DUAA's approach as a pragmatic balance between protecting individuals' rights and reducing unnecessary barriers to global data flows. The ICO emphasises that organisations must still ensure accountability and transparency. The risk-based approach must be well-documented and justified.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Review international transfer policies. Update internal and client-facing documentation to reflect the risk based approach.
- Support transfer risk assessments. Help clients conduct and document Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs). Provide templates and tools for evaluating third-country risks.
- Monitor adequacy decisions and SCC updates. Track changes to the UK’s list of adequate countries. Ensure clients use up-to-date SCCs or other approved safeguards.
- Educate clients on the new flexibility. Clarify that while the DUAA offers more flexibility, due diligence is still required. Emphasise the importance of proportionality and documentation.

#### 9. Responding to complaints

The DUAA introduces new duties and expectations for how organisations and the ICO handle data protection complaints from individuals. These changes aim to improve transparency and accountability in complaint handling, to streamline the ICO’s role in resolving issues and to encourage early and effective resolution by organisations.

The ICO is now required to consider whether the complainant has first raised the issue with the organisation before investigating. This encourages individuals to engage directly with the organisation before escalating to the regulator.

The DUAA promotes a “resolve-it-yourself-first” approach. Individuals are expected to contact the organisation directly. Organisations are expected to have clear, accessible complaint-handling procedures.

The ICO now has greater discretion to decline to investigate complaints that are frivolous, vexatious, or repetitive. Prioritise complaints that raise systemic or high-risk issues.

The ICO is expected to be more transparent about how it handles complaints, when and why it chooses not to investigate and the outcome of its investigations.

The ICO supports these changes as a way to empower individuals to resolve issues directly, reduce regulatory burden by focusing on serious or widespread concerns and promote better internal complaint handling by organisations.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Cybercy should help clients strengthen complaint procedures. Ensure clients have a clear, accessible and responsive process for handling data protection complaints. Include templates and escalation paths.
- Train staff on early resolution - encourage front line teams to resolve issues quickly and empathetically. Document all interactions in case of ICO involvement.
- Help clients understand when the ICO is likely to decline or accept a complaint. Support them in preparing evidence of internal resolution efforts.
- The ICO is reviewing its complaint handling guidance to reflect DUAA changes.

#### 10. storage and access technologies such as cookies

The DUAA updates the rules around the use of cookies and similar technologies (e.g. local storage, tracking pixels) under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). These changes aim to reduce friction for low-risk uses of cookies, clarify consent requirements and support user experience and innovation while maintaining privacy protections.

The DUAA expands the types of cookies and technologies that can be used without prior consent, including analytics cookies which are used to measure website performance, if the data is anonymised or low risk. There's also security-related cookies for things like fraud prevention or access control. And there's also cookies used to remember user settings or preferences.

These exemptions apply only if the use is proportionate and non-intrusive, and users are clearly informed.

For cookies that involve tracking or profiling, consent is still required. The DUAA reinforces that consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Pre-ticked boxes or implied consent are not valid.

The DUAA encourages the development of browser-level or device-level consent mechanisms. This could reduce the need for repetitive cookie banners, especially for frequent users.

The ICO supports these changes as a way to simplify compliance for organisations, reduce banner fatigue for users and maintain strong protections for personal data. The ICO will update its cookie guidance to reflect which cookies fall under the new exemptions, how to implement transparent cookie notices and best practices for user-friendly consent mechanisms.

What this means for Cybercy:

- We need to review cookie policies and notices, to help clients identify which cookies now qualify for exemption. And also ensure that cookie banners and notices are clear and compliant.
- We need to also advise clients in configuring Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to reflect DUAA exemptions. To encourage granular consent options for tracking technologies.
- Stay informed about new classifications of cookies and technologies. Track developments in browser-based consent tools.
- Clarify that low-risk analytics may not require consent, but profiling and advertising still do.

#### 11. changes to Parts 3 and 4 of the DPA Act 2018

The DUAA introduces target updates to Part 3 of the DPA 2018: Governs the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes. And updates for Part 4 of the DPA 2018: Governs the processing of personal data by intelligence services. These changes are not broad in scope, but they are significant for the sectors they affect.

The DUAA makes technical and clarifying amendments to ensure consistency with the broader reforms in the Act. These include terminology alignment with the rest of the DUAA, as well as updates to definitions and procedural rules and adjustments to oversight and enforcement mechanisms.

The ICO notes that these changes are not intended to significantly alter the legal framework for law enforcement or intelligence processing. Instead they aim to improve clarity and ensure coherence with the updated UK data protection regime.

The ICO acknowledges the changes but does not highlight them as transformative. These updates are primarily relevant to law enforcement agencies, public authorities and national security bodies.

What this means for Cybercy:

- If Cybercy's clients don't process data under Part 3 or 4, these changes are unlikely to affect them directly. However as long as we work with or advise police forces, regulatory bodies, government departments, security or intelligence services then we should do the following:
    - Make sure clients understand the revised obligations under Part 3 and 4.
    - Monitor ICO guidance as they might issue updates for competent authorities and intelligence services.
    - Align internal policies with the updated definitions and procedures introduced by the DUAA.

#### 12. Criminal Offence for Non-Consensual Deepfake Images

During the DUAA’s passage through Parliament, lawmakers introduced a new criminal offence targeting the creation and distribution of digitally altered sexually explicit images, commonly referred to as deepfakes, without the subject’s consent.

This is a criminal law reform, not a data protection rule, but it intersects with privacy and dignity rights and has implications for data governance and digital ethics.

The offence applies to digitally generated or altered images that appear sexually explicit. And cases where the depicted individual did not consent to the creation or sharing of the image. The offence is intended to:

- deter malicious use of AI and image manipulation technologies
- provide legal recourse for victims of image-based abuse
- address a growing gap in the law around synthetic media and online harms

The ICO supports the creation of this offence, stating it is the most effective way to address this type of harm. The Commissioner notes this is not a data protection issue alone, it requires criminal enforcement. The offence complements existing privacy protections under UK GDPR and the DPA 2018. The ICO also raises two important concerns:

1. Human Rights Compatibility: There were Parliamentary concerns about whether the offence is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ICO calls for government assurance that this has been fully assessed.
2. Adequacy Implications: The ICO highlights the need to consider how this offence might affect the UK’s adequacy status with the European Commission. Adequacy is crucial for unrestricted data flows between the UK and EU.

What this means for Cybercy:

- Understand that deepfake-related harms are now addressed through criminal law, not just data protection.
- Help clients using AI or image generation tools to assess the legal and ethical risks of their technologies.
- Reinforce the importance of explicit consent when using personal likenesses in digital content.

### Other Notable Developments

#### Customer and Business Data Access & Interface Bodies

Part 1 of the DUAA 2025 establishes a new legal framework for enabling individuals and businesses to access and share their data held by service providers. This is designed to support data portability, competition, and innovation in regulated sectors.

The Secretary of State is empowered to make regulations requiring organisations to provide access to customer or business data upon request. This includes data generated through the use of services (e.g. energy usage, financial transactions).

The Act introduces **“interface bodies”** which are trusted intermediaries that facilitate secure and standardised data sharing between individuals/businesses and data holders. These bodies may authenticate users, manage consent, route data requests and ensure compliance with technical and legal standards.

The Act allows for the creation of data access gateways to streamline and standardise how data is shared across sectors.

The FCA and other regulators are given powers to enforce compliance. The ICO retains a role in ensuring data protection principles are upheld.

The ICO supports the framework as a way to empower individuals and businesses to control their data. It emphasises the need for strong safeguards, clear consent mechanisms and transparency in how data is accessed and used.

What this means for Cybercy:

- If our company or clients operate in regular sectors (e.g. finance, energy, telecoms) we should so the following:
    - Monitor sector-specific future DUAA regulations
    - Prepare for Data Portability Requests, so ensure that systems can export data securely and in a usable format.
    - Consider partnerships or integrations with emerging interface bodies.
    - Align with the DUAA's emphasis on user control and transparency

#### Digital Verification Services (DVS) Trust Framework

Part 2 of the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 establishes a legal framework for Digital Verification Services (DVS) services that verify identity or attributes digitally. This is designed to support secure, trusted digital identity systems in the UK.

DVS Trust Framework is a formal trust framework is created to govern how digital verification services operate. It sets out technical, security, and governance standards for providers. The framework is maintained by the Secretary of State and may be updated over time.

The Secretary of State may issue supplementary codes of practice to provide detailed guidance on compliance with the trust framework. These codes are not legally binding, but are highly persuasive in enforcement and certification decisions.

The DVS Register is an established public register of certified DVS providers . Only providers who meet the framework's standards can be listed.

Certified providers may display a **trust mark** to signal compliance and build user confidence. The trust mark can be withdrawn if a provider fails to meet standards.

The Act creates a legal gateway for public authorities (e.g. HMRC) to share information with certified DVS providers, under strict conditions.

The ICO supports the DVS framework as a way to promote secure and privacy-respecting digital identity systems and ensure transparency and accountability in how identity data is processed. The ICO will provide guidance to help DVS providers comply with UK GDPR and data minimisation principles.

What this means for Cybercy:

- If our clients are involved in digital identity, authentication or KYC services, we should do the following:
    - Align with the framework's security, governance and transparency requirements.
    - Stay updated on any sector specific guidance issued under the framework
    - Help clients understand how to earn and maintain the trust mark, and what it means for user trust.
    - If working with public authorities, ensure data sharing is lawful and proportionate under the new gateway rules.

#### Financial Services Interfaces

The DUAA 2025 (Part 1, Section 14) introduces a framework for standardised data interfaces in the financial services sector, enabling more secure, consistent, and regulated data sharing between financial institutions, third parties, and interface bodies.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is empowered to create **“interface rules”** that:  
- Require financial services providers to use prescribed interfaces.  
- Mandate compliance with interface standards or participation in interface arrangements.  
- Apply to both data providers and data recipients in the financial sector.

These rules apply to financial services regulated by the FCA, third parties receiving customer or business data from financial institutions as well as interface bodies and other actors involved in data access or exchange.

The rules may cover governance and composition of interface bodies, technical standards for data exchange, security and interoperability requirements.

The Treasury may issue regulations to support the FCA's role. The framework is designed to align with broader data access regulations under the DUAA.

While the ICO does not directly regulate financial services, it supports the use of standardised, secure interfaces to improve data portability and consumer control, as well as ensuring privacy and security in financial data sharing. The ICO will likely coordinate with the FCA to ensure data protection compliance in interface design and use.

What this means for Cybercy:

- If our clients operate in or serve the financial services sector, we should:
    - stay informed about upcoming FCA regulations and technical standards.
    - evaluate whether our systems can integrate with prescribed interfaces.
    - help clients implement privacy-by-design in their data exchange process.
    - engage with or advise interface bodies to ensure compliance with both FCA and data protection requirements.

#### Information Sharing by Public Authorities

The DUAA 2025 introduces a statutory gateway that allows certain public authorities, including HMRC, Revenue Scotland, and the Welsh Revenue Authority, to share information with certified Digital Verification Services (DVS) providers. This gateway also extends to other entities operating under the DVS Trust Framework. The goal is to support secure and efficient identity verification processes.

The information shared under this gateway can only be used for the purpose of verifying an individual’s identity or specific attributes. This is intended to facilitate secure onboarding, prevent fraud, and streamline access to both public and private services that rely on trusted identity checks.

To ensure responsible use, all disclosures must comply with the data protection principles set out in the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Additionally, any codes of practice issued by the Secretary of State must be followed. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) retains oversight to ensure that all disclosures are lawful, necessary, and proportionate.

Transparency is a key requirement. Public authorities and DVS providers must ensure that individuals are clearly informed about how their data is being used. This includes providing appropriate privacy notices that explain the purpose and scope of the data sharing.

The ICO supports the introduction of this gateway, viewing it as a positive step toward enabling trusted digital identity ecosystems. It also sees value in improving the efficiency and security of data interactions between public and private sectors. However, the ICO stresses the importance of maintaining a clear legal basis for each disclosure, adhering to data minimisation and purpose limitation principles, and building public trust through transparency.

What this means for Cybercy:

- If we have clients that work with public sector data, identity verification, or government services, we need to make sure of a few things:
    - ensure any data sharing with public authorities is lawful and documented
    - help clients implement privacy-by-design when integrating with public data sources
    - ensure individuals are clearly informed about any data sharing with public bodies
    - stay alert for supplementary codes that may define how disclosures should be handled.

#### Trust Mark and Certification

The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 introduces a Trust Mark scheme as part of the Digital Verification Services (DVS) Trust Framework. This initiative is designed to help individuals and organisations identify trustworthy digital identity providers and promote confidence in digital verification systems.

The Trust Mark is a visual indicator that a DVS provider has been certified as compliant with the standards set out in the DVS Trust Framework. Only providers listed on the official DVS Register, maintained by the Secretary of State, are eligible to display the Trust Mark.

To qualify, providers must meet technical, security, and governance standards defined in the framework and any supplementary codes of practice. These standards are designed to ensure that digital identity services are secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable.

The Trust Mark can be revoked if a provider fails to maintain compliance. This ensures that the mark remains a credible signal of trustworthiness and that certified providers are held to ongoing standards.

The ICO supports the Trust Mark as a tool to build public trust in digital identity systems. It sees the certification process as a way to encourage high standards in data protection, transparency, and accountability.

However, the ICO also emphasises that certification does not override legal obligations under the UK GDPR or DPA 2018. Certified providers must still ensure that their processing of personal data is lawful, fair, and transparent, and that they uphold data subject rights.

Why this matters for Cybercy:

- If our company or clients operate in the digital identity, authentication, or verification space, the Trust Mark may become a valuable differentiator. We should do the following:
    - Review the DVS Trust Framework and determine whether your services meet the criteria.
    - Help clients implement the necessary technical and organisational measures to qualify for certification.
    - Ensure clients understand the conditions for displaying the Trust Mark and the implications of non-compliance.
    - Stay informed about changes to the framework, supplementary codes, and the certification process.
