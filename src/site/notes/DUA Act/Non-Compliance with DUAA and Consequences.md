The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 is a UK law that came into force on 19 June 2025. It updates how personal and non-personal data is used, shared, and protected across the UK. The Act aims to make data use more efficient and secure, while still protecting people’s rights and privacy.

It works alongside the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, and introduces new rules for:

- Public and private sector data sharing
- Law enforcement data processing
- International data transfers
- Certification and oversight

#### What counts as non-compliance?

- Breaking any of the data protection principles like fairness, accuracy or security
- Violate individual rights under the Act such as access or correction rights
- Transfer data to other countries without proper safeguards
- Fail to meet administrative obligations, such as record-keeping or cooperation with the ICO
- Ignore or fail to follow ICO enforcement notices

#### The Penalties
The ICO can issue monetary penalties under Part 6 of the Act, depending on the severity of the breach.

1. Higher Maximum Penalty
	- It's up to £17.5 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever one is higher applies
	- Penalty applies to serious breaches such as:
		- violating data protection principles
		- ignoring individual rights
		- unlawful international data transfers

2. Standard Maximum Penalty
	- It's up to £8.7 million or 2% of global annual turnover, again, whichever one turns out to be higher.
	- Penalty applies to less serious breaches like:
		- administrative failings
		- poor record-keeping
		- failure to appoint a required data protection officer

Besides just the fines, the ICO can also take the following actions:
- issue warnings or reprimands
- order organisations to stop processing data
- require changes to how data is handled
- conduct audits or investigations
This is all assessed on a case-by-case basis.
