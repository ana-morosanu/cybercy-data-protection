The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is a landmark regulation aimed at ensuring that digital products and services sold within the European Union are secure by design and remain secure throughout their lifecycle. It applies to both hardware and software products with digital elements, including those that rely on remote data processing. The CRA is part of the EU's broader strategy to strengthen cybersecurity across the internal market and reduce the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.

The regulation targets a wide range of stakeholders, including software developers, hardware manufacturers, and service providers. However, it excludes sectors already covered by existing EU cybersecurity frameworks, such as medical devices, motor vehicles, civil aviation, and marine equipment. These exemptions are in place to avoid regulatory overlap and ensure consistency across different legal instruments.

The CRA was provisionally adopted in March 2024, with its official publication expected in October 2024. The timeline for compliance is staggered: incident reporting obligations will begin in October 2026, while full enforcement of the regulation will commence in October 2027. This phased approach is designed to give manufacturers and other stakeholders sufficient time to adapt to the new requirements.

At the heart of the CRA are two main sets of obligations outlined in Annex 1. The first set focuses on product security requirements, mandating secure default configurations, protection against unauthorized access, and the safeguarding of data confidentiality and integrity. It also emphasizes data minimization, ensuring that only the necessary data is collected and processed. The second set of obligations pertains to vulnerability management. Manufacturers are required to monitor for vulnerabilities, report any that are actively exploited, provide timely security updates, and maintain a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy.

To demonstrate compliance, products must undergo a conformity assessment. Low-risk products can be self-assessed by the manufacturer, while high-risk or critical products must be evaluated by a third-party certification body. The European Commission will support this process by developing harmonized standards and guidelines to help manufacturers meet their obligations. Once a product is deemed compliant, it must bear the CE marking, indicating that it meets the CRAâ€™s cybersecurity requirements.


So the EU Cyber Resilience Act focuses on:
- Ensuring Baseline Security
- Accountability
- Transparency
- Improving Incident Response

Risks the CRA Addresses:
- Low Cybersecurity Standards and Lack of Updates
- Insufficient Consumer Information
