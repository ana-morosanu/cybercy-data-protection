Article 9 focuses on protecting a specific type of personal data known as special category data. This kind of data is considered more sensitive than regular personal data and, if misused, it could lead to discrimination of harm. Because of this, the law places stricter rules on how it can be collected, used or shared.

### What counts as Special Category Data?
Special category data includes information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union memberships, genetic data, biometric data (when used to identify someone), health data and data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.

### The general rule is: No Processing Unless Conditions Are Met
The default position under Article 9 is that you are not allowed to process special category data. However, there are exceptions. You can only process this data if you meet two requirements:
1. You must have a lawful basis under Article 6 of the UK GDPR (such as consent, legal obligation or legitimate interest).
2. You must also meet one of the specific conditions listed in Article 9(2).

### The 10 Conditions for Processing Special Category Data (9(2))

1. **Explicit Consent** - this means that the individual has clearly agreed to the use of their special category data for a specific purpose. This consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. It must also be confirmed through a clear statement, either written or spoken, not just implied by actions like ticking a box. The person must also be able to withdraw their consent at any time. You must be especially careful when asking for consent if you're in a position of power over the individual (like an employer), as this could affect whether the consent is truly voluntary.

2. **Employment, Social Security or Social Protection Law** - you can process special category data if it's necessary to meet obligations or exercise rights in the field of employment, social security or social protection. For example, this might include processing health data to manage sick leave or workplace adjustments. This condition must be supported by UK law and usually requires safeguards such as an appropriate policy document.

3. **Vital Interests** - this applies when processing is necessary to protect someone's life, and the person is physically or legally unable to give consent. For example, in a medical emergency where the individual is unconscious, you may need to process their health data to provide treatment. This condition is only likely to apply in rare, urgent situations.

4. **Not-for-Profit Organisations** - if you are a not-for-profit body (such as a charity, political party or a religious organisation), you can process special category data about your members, former members or people you have regular contact with. The data must not be disclosed outside the organisation without consent. This condition helps such organisations manage their internal affairs, like keeping membership records or organising events.

5. **Made Public by the Individual** - you can process special category data if the individual has clearly made it public themselves. This means they have deliberately shared the information in a way that makes it accessible to others. For example, by posting it on a public website or social media. You must be sure that the disclosure was intentional and not accidental. 

6. **Legal Claims or Courts** - you can process special category data if it's necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. This also includes processing required for courts acting in their judicial capacity. This condition allows organisations to use sensitive data in legal disputes, investigations or proceedings. 

7. **Substantial Public Interest** - this condition applies when the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest and is supported by UK law. The Data Protection Act 2018 lists 23 specific purposes under this condition, such as preventing fraud, safeguarding children or promoting equality. You must be able to show that the processing is necessary and proportionate and you usually need an appropriate policy document in place.

8. **Health or Social Care** - you can process special category data if it's necessary to provide health or social care services, including preventative or occupational medicine. This condition only applies if the processing is carried out by a health professional or someone else who is legally bound to keep the information confidential. It covers activities like medical diagnosis, treatment and care planning. 

9. **Public Health** - this condition allows processing for public health purposes, such as protecting against serious cross-border health threats or ensuring high standards of healthcare. It must be carried out by someone with legal responsibility for public health, such as public health authority. This condition was often used during the COVID-19 pandemic for contact tracing and vaccination programmes.

10. **Archiving, Research or Statistics** - you can process special category data for archiving in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes. The processing must be proportionate, respect data minimisation principles, and include measures like pseudonymisation where possible. This condition supports academic and public interest research while protecting individuals' rights.
