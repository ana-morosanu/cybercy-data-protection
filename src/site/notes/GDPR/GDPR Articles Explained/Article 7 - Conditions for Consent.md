Under Article 4(11) consent is defined as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

Article 7 also sets out further ‘conditions’ for consent, with specific provisions on:
- keeping records to demonstrate consent;
- prominence and clarity of consent requests;
- the right to withdraw consent easily and at any time; and
- freely given consent if a contract is conditional on consent

### 7(1) - Demonstrating Consent 

**How to Record Consent**

The law states that “where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of their personal data.” This means you must be able to prove that valid consent was given, and that it met all the requirements of being freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

To meet this requirement, you should:

1. **Keep a detailed record of consent**  
    You need an audit trail showing:
    - Who gave consent
    - When they gave it
    - How they gave it (e.g. online form, verbal agreement, written signature)
    - What they were told at the time (e.g. privacy notice, purpose of processing)
    
2. **Be specific and transparent**  
    Record the exact wording used in the consent request. Include:
    - The name of your organisation
    - Any third parties who will rely on the consent
    - The specific purposes for which the data will be used  
        Consent should be **granular**, meaning individuals can choose which specific purposes they agree to.
    
3. **Use consent logs or dashboards**  
    Consider using tools like consent management platforms or privacy dashboards to track and manage consent. These tools help ensure that consent is:
    - Up-to-date
    - Revocable (capable of being cancelled)
    - Verifiable (able to be checked or demonstrated to be true, accurate or justified)
    
4. **Be ready to show evidence**  
    If challenged by a regulator or individual, you must be able to produce evidence of valid consent. This includes showing that the individual:
    - Was properly informed
    - Freely gave their consent
    - Had a genuine choice
    
5. **Track versions of consent wording**  
    If you use layered privacy notices or update your consent forms over time, keep a record of which version was shown to the individual at the time they gave consent. This helps demonstrate that the consent was informed and valid.
    
6. **Review and refresh consent periodically**  
    For long-term processing, it’s good practice to set a review period and refresh consent where appropriate. This ensures that the consent remains valid and reflects any changes in your processing activities or relationship with the individual.
    

**Example of Good Practice:**  
A company collects email addresses for marketing. They use a form with a clear checkbox (not pre-ticked), stating:  
“I agree to receive marketing emails from Example_Company. I understand I can unsubscribe at any time.”  
The system logs the date, time, and IP address of the user, and stores a copy of the consent wording shown at the time. The company also tracks which version of the privacy notice was displayed and sets a reminder to review consent every 12 months.

### 7(2) - Clear and Separate Consent Requests - how to write a consent request

**How to Write a Consent Request**

Under Article 7(2) of the UK GDPR, when you ask someone for their consent, the request must be presented in a way that is **clear, separate, and easy to understand**. Consent should never be hidden in long documents or bundled in with other terms and conditions. The goal is to ensure that individuals know exactly what they are agreeing to, and that they are doing so freely and knowingly.

To meet this standard, your consent request should be written in **plain, straightforward language**. Avoid legal jargon, technical terms, or vague phrases. The request should be prominently displayed, not buried in footnotes or small print. If you’re asking for consent as part of a larger document (like a contract or privacy policy), it must be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the content, for example, using headings, spacing, or formatting to make it stand out.

You should also make sure that the consent request is specific. If you’re collecting data for more than one purpose, you should ask for consent separately for each purpose. This is known as granular consent. For example, someone might agree to receive your newsletter but not to have their data shared with third parties, and your form should allow them to make that choice.

Finally, your consent request must include a clear explanation of the individual’s right to withdraw consent at any time. This should be stated before they give consent, and ideally include how they can do it (e.g. through a link, settings page, or contact email).

Good Practice Checklist:
- Use **plain English**, no jargon or complex legal terms.
- Make the request **stand out** from other content.
- Be **specific** about what the person is consenting to.
- Offer **separate options** for different types of processing.
- Clearly explain the **right to withdraw consent** and how to do it.

### 7(3) - Right to Withdraw Consent - how to manage the right to withdraw consent

**How to Manage the Right to Withdraw Consent**

Under Article 7(3) of the UK GDPR, individuals have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. This right is essential to ensuring that consent remains a genuine and ongoing choice. If someone changes their mind, they must be able to take back their consent easily, without facing any pressure, delay, or negative consequences.

The process for withdrawing consent must be as simple as the process for giving it. For example, if you collected consent through a simple online form or a checkbox, then you should offer a similarly straightforward way to withdraw it such as an unsubscribe link, a toggle in account settings, or a short email request. You should not require people to explain their reasons or go through a complicated process.

You must also inform individuals of their right to withdraw consent before they give it. This means your consent request should clearly state that they can withdraw at any time, and ideally explain how they can do so. This helps ensure that the consent is informed and freely given.

Once someone withdraws their consent, you must stop processing their data for that purpose immediately, unless you have another lawful basis to continue. For example, if you were relying solely on consent to send marketing emails, you must stop sending them as soon as consent is withdrawn.

Your systems and processes should be designed to handle withdrawals efficiently. This includes updating your records, stopping the relevant processing, and ensuring that any third parties who received the data based on that consent are also informed.

Good Practice Checklist:
- Make withdrawal **as easy as giving consent**.
- Clearly explain the right to withdraw **before consent is given**.
- Stop processing the data **immediately** after withdrawal (unless another lawful basis applies).
- Ensure your systems can **track and act on withdrawals** quickly.
- Inform any **third parties** who received the data under the original consent.

### 7(4) - Freely Given Consent - what information to include in a consent request and how to manage consent

**How to Ensure Consent Is Truly Voluntary**

Article 7(4) of the UK GDPR focuses on whether consent is **freely given**. This means that individuals must have a **genuine choice** about whether or not to give their consent. If someone feels pressured, tricked, or forced into agreeing, then the consent is not valid.

The law specifically says that when assessing whether consent is freely given, you must take utmost account of whether the performance of a contract, including access to a service, is made conditional on consent to process personal data that is not necessary for that contract. In other words, you cannot make people agree to unnecessary data processing just to use your service.

For example, if someone is buying a product from your website, and you require them to consent to their data being shared with unrelated third parties (like marketing partners) as part of the checkout process, that consent is not freely given. It’s being used as a condition of sale, even though it’s not necessary to complete the purchase. That kind of consent would be invalid.

However, if the data processing is genuinely necessary to deliver the service such as sharing a customer’s address with a courier to deliver their order then it may be acceptable. In that case, consent might not even be the most appropriate lawful basis; performance of a contract could apply instead.

You should also be especially careful in situations where there is a power imbalance, such as between an employer and employee. In these cases, it may be difficult to show that consent was freely given, because the individual might feel they have no real choice.

Good Practice Checklist:
- Don’t make consent a **condition of service** unless the processing is **strictly necessary**.
- Offer people a **real choice**, they should be able to say no without losing access to the service.
- Avoid **bundling consent** with other terms and conditions.
- Be cautious in **power-imbalanced relationships** (e.g. employer-employee).
- Use **granular consent** options so people can choose what they agree to.
