### **What is an Information Society Service (ISS)?**

An Information Society Service is any service that is provided online, usually for some kind of payment, and is delivered electronically at the request of the user. This includes things like websites, apps, online games, streaming platforms, and social media. Even if the service is free to use, it still counts as an ISS if it makes money in other ways, like through advertising or collecting and using personal data. The key idea is that the service is digital, interactive, and accessed over the internet.
<br><br>
### **When is an ISS offered directly to a child?**

An online service is considered to be offered directly to a child when it is clearly aimed at children or when children are likely to use it, even if they are not the main audience. This includes services that use child-friendly language, characters, or designs, or that promote themselves in places where children are active, like on kids’ TV channels or school platforms. Even if the service is meant for adults, if children regularly use it, it still counts as being offered to them. What matters is whether the service is likely to attract or be used by children, not just who it was originally intended for.

### **Age Thresholds for Consent**

In the UK, a child must be at least 13 years old to give their own consent for an online service to collect and use their personal data. If the child is under 13, the service must get permission from someone who has parental responsibility for that child, usually a parent or legal guardian.

This rule only applies when the service is relying on consent as the legal reason for using the child's data. If the service is using a different legal reason, like fulfilling a contract or protecting someone's safety, then this age rule might not apply in the same way.

The UK chose 13 as the minimum age, but other countries in Europe can set it higher - up to 16.

### **Legal Basis and When Article 8 Applies**

Article 8 only applies when an online service is using **consent** as the legal reason for collecting and using a child’s personal data. This means that if a service is asking for permission to use a child’s data, like ticking a box or clicking “I agree”, then Article 8 sets the rules for how that consent must be handled.

But consent is just one of several legal reasons a service might rely on. For example, if the service needs to use the data to carry out a contract, or if it has a legitimate interest that doesn’t override the child’s rights, then Article 8 doesn’t apply in the same way. In those cases, the service still has to protect the child’s data, but it doesn’t need to follow the specific consent rules in Article 8.

So, Article 8 is only triggered when the service chooses to rely on consent. If it does, and the user is a child, then the service must follow the age rules and get parental permission if needed.

### **Reasonable Efforts to Verify Parental Consent**

If a child is under 13 and an online service wants to rely on consent to use their personal data, the service must get permission from someone who has parental responsibility. But it’s not enough to just ask, the service must also take reasonable steps to make sure that the person giving consent really is the child’s parent or guardian.

What counts as “reasonable” depends on the type of service, the risks involved, and the technology available. For example, a service might ask for an email confirmation, use a verification code, or request some form of ID. The more sensitive the data or the higher the risk to the child, the stronger the verification process should be.

The goal is to protect children by making sure that consent is genuine and not easily faked, while still being practical and not overly complicated for families to use.

### **DPIA Requirement**

A Data Protection Impact Assessment, or DPIA, is a process that helps organisations identify and reduce the risks that their data processing might pose to people’s rights, especially when those people are children. If an online service is likely to be accessed by children, and it collects or uses their personal data, then a DPIA is usually required.

This is because children are more vulnerable and less likely to understand how their data is being used. The law assumes that services aimed at or likely to be used by children carry a high risk to their rights and freedoms. That’s why the GDPR says a DPIA must be done before starting any such data processing.

The DPIA should be carried out early in the design of the service, not after it’s already running. It should look at what data is being collected, why it’s needed, how it will be used, and what could go wrong. It should also consider the different ages and needs of children who might use the service, and include steps to reduce any risks.

Doing a DPIA is not just a legal requirement, it’s also a way to show that the organisation is taking children’s privacy seriously and building protections into the service from the start.

### **Cookies and Consent**

When an online service uses cookies or similar technologies to track users, especially for things like advertising or profiling, it must get clear and informed consent from the user. This rule applies to everyone, including children.

If the user is under 13, and the service relies on consent to use cookies, then that consent must come from someone with parental responsibility. The service must also make sure that the child or their parent understands what the cookies do and why they’re being used.

This means the cookie banner or pop-up must be written in simple, age-appropriate language. It should explain what data is being collected, how it will be used, and give a real choice to accept or reject cookies. Just saying “by using this site you agree” is not enough, the user must actively agree.

If the cookies are essential for the service to work (like keeping items in a shopping cart), then consent isn’t needed. But for anything beyond that, like tracking, analytics, or advertising, proper consent is required, and the rules for children must be followed.
<br><br>
### **Contract Law Considerations**

Even though the GDPR sets rules about consent for children, it doesn’t change the basic rules of contract law. If an online service is using a contract as the legal reason to collect and use a child’s data, it must still follow UK contract law to decide whether the child is old enough to enter into that contract.

In the UK, there’s no fixed age at which a child can legally agree to a contract. Instead, it depends on whether the child understands what they are agreeing to. This is called having the “capacity to contract.” If a child is old enough and mature enough to understand the terms and consequences of the agreement, then the contract may be valid.

So, if a service is relying on a contract instead of consent, it must think carefully about whether the child can truly understand what they are signing up for. If not, the contract might not be legally binding, and the service could be breaking the law by using the child’s data.

This means that even if the GDPR doesn’t require parental consent in these cases, the service still has a duty to make sure the child is capable of entering into a contract, and to explain things in a way the child can understand.

### **Best Practices**

When designing and running online services that children might use, organisations should go beyond just meeting the legal minimum. They should actively design their services in ways that protect children’s privacy and support their rights.

This starts with using clear, simple language that children can understand. Privacy notices, cookie banners, and consent forms should be written in a way that matches the age and understanding of the child. Avoid legal jargon or vague explanations.

Services should also be built with children’s best interests in mind. This means thinking about how the service might affect a child’s wellbeing, safety, and ability to make informed choices. For example, avoid using design tricks that pressure children into sharing more data than they need to, or that make it hard to say no.

It’s also important to give children control over their data in ways they can understand and use. This might include easy-to-find settings, clear explanations of what happens when they change those settings, and the ability to ask questions or get help.

Finally, organisations should regularly review how their services are used by children and update their practices as needed. This includes checking that consent processes are still working, that privacy information is still clear, and that risks are being managed as technology and user behaviour change.
