---


Article 10 of the UK GDPR sets out strict rules for processing personal data relating to criminal convictions, offences, or related security measures. This type of data is considered sensitive and is given extra protection under the law, similar to special category data, but with its own specific rules.

You can only process criminal offence data if:
- The processing is under the control of official authority, or
- The processing is authorised by UK law, and that law includes appropriate safeguards for individuals' rights and freedoms.

This means you cannot process criminal offence data just because you have a lawful basis under Article 6. You must also meet one of these two additional requirements.

### The meaning of "Under the Control of Official Authority"
This refers to public bodies or organisations that have legal powers to process criminal offence data as part of their official duties. These powers must come from statute or common law.

Examples include:
- The police
- The courts
- The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)
- The DVLA
- Other public authorities with legal duties involving criminal records

If your organisation has this kind of authority, you do **not** need to identify a separate legal condition under the Data Protection Act 2018.

### What If the Company Doesn’t Have Official Authority?

If the company is a private organisation or a public body without specific legal powers, they can only process criminal offence data if:
- You have a lawful basis under **Article 6**, and
- You meet a condition under **Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018**

These Schedule 1 conditions are similar to those for special category data and include things like:
- Employment and safeguarding obligations
- Legal claims
- Preventing fraud
- Substantial public interest

In most cases, they'll also need to have an appropriate policy document in place explaining:
- Their procedures for handling the data
- How long you’ll keep it
- How you protect it

### Comprehensive Registers?

Article 10 includes a special rule:

> **“Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority.”**

This means only public bodies with legal powers can maintain a full database of criminal records. Private organisations cannot create or maintain such registers, even if they collect some criminal offence data for specific purposes (like background checks).

### Other responsibilities

Processing criminal offence data can trigger additional responsibilities, especially if done on a large scale or in high-risk contexts. You may need to:

- Complete a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**
- Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** if required
- Include clear information in your **privacy notice**
- Apply **data minimisation** and **security measures**
- Keep detailed **records of processing activities**
