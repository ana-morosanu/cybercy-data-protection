<br>
Before you collect or use someone’s personal data, you need a **lawful reason** for doing it. Article 6 sets out **six lawful bases** and you must choose the one that best fits your purpose. You can’t just pick one at random or switch between them later without a valid reason.
<br>
## 6(1)(a) Consent

Consent means the individual has given you clear permission to use their personal data for a specific purpose. It must be a real, informed choice, not something hidden in the small print or assumed by default.

###### What makes consent valid?
To meet the UK GDPR standard, consent must be:

- **Freely given**: The person must have a genuine choice. If they feel pressured or if saying no would cause them problems (like losing access to a service), then it’s not valid.
- **Specific and informed**: You must explain clearly what data you’re collecting, why you’re collecting it, and how it will be used. If you’re doing more than one thing with the data, you need separate consent for each purpose.
- **Unambiguous**: The person must take a clear, positive action to give consent  like ticking a box or clicking “I agree.” Pre-ticked boxes or silence don’t count.
- **Documented**: You must keep a record of who gave consent, when, how, and what they were told at the time.
- **Easy to withdraw**: People must be able to take back their consent at any time, and it should be as easy to withdraw as it was to give. You must stop processing their data as soon as they withdraw.

###### When should you use consent?
Consent is one of six lawful bases. It’s best used when people have a real choice and control over how their data is used, for example, in marketing, research, or optional services. If you can’t offer a genuine choice, or if the processing is necessary for something like a contract or legal duty, then consent is not the right basis.

Public authorities and employers should be especially careful. Because of the power imbalance, it’s harder to show that consent was freely given.

Some situations, like processing special category data (e.g. health, religion, ethnicity) require **explicit consent**. This means the person must give a very clear and specific statement agreeing to the use of their data. It’s a higher standard than regular consent.

###### How should you ask for consent?
Consent requests must be separate from other terms and conditions. They should be written in plain language and clearly explain what the person is agreeing to. If you’re sharing data with other organisations, you must name them. You should also give people options, for example, letting them agree to one type of communication but not another. This is called “granular” consent.

###### How do you manage consent?
You need to regularly review consents to make sure they’re still valid. If anything changes, like the purpose or the way you use the data, you may need to ask for consent again. You should also have a clear process for handling withdrawals and make sure people aren’t penalised for changing their mind.

***Checklists for consent:***

Asking for Consent:
	☐ We have checked that consent is the most appropriate lawful basis for processing.
	☐ We have made the request for consent prominent and separate from our terms and conditions.
	☐ We ask people to positively opt in.
	☐ We don’t use pre-ticked boxes or any other type of default consent.
	☐ We use clear, plain language that is easy to understand.
	☐ We specify why we want the data and what we’re going to do with it.
	☐ We give separate distinct (‘granular’) options to consent separately to different purposes and types of processing.
	☐ We name our organisation and any third party controllers who will be relying on the consent.
	☐ We tell individuals they can withdraw their consent.
	☐ We ensure that individuals can refuse to consent without detriment.
	☐ We avoid making consent a precondition of a service.
	☐ If we offer online services directly to children, we only seek consent if we have age-verification measures (and parental-consent measures for younger children) in place.

Recording consent:
	☐ We keep a record of when and how we got consent from the individual.
	☐ We keep a record of exactly what they were told at the time.

Managing consent:
	☐ We regularly review consents to check that the relationship, the processing and the purposes have not changed.
	☐ We have processes in place to refresh consent at appropriate intervals, including any parental consents.
	☐ We consider using privacy dashboards or other preference-management tools as a matter of good practice.
	☐ We make it easy for individuals to withdraw their consent at any time, and publicise how to do so.
	☐ We act on withdrawals of consent as soon as we can.
	☐ We don’t penalise individuals who wish to withdraw consent.

Overall Idea of Consent:
- The UK GDPR sets a high standard for consent. But you often won’t need consent. If consent is difficult, look for a different lawful basis.
- Consent means offering individuals real choice and control. Genuine consent should put individuals in charge, build trust and engagement, and enhance your reputation.
- Check your consent practices and your existing consents. Refresh your consents if they don’t meet the UK GDPR standard.
- Consent requires a positive opt-in. Don’t use pre-ticked boxes or any other method of default consent.
- Explicit consent requires a very clear and specific statement of consent.
- Keep your consent requests separate from other terms and conditions.
- Be specific and ‘granular’ so that you get separate consent for separate things. Vague or blanket consent is not enough.
- Be clear and concise.
- Name any third party controllers who will rely on the consent.
- Make it easy for people to withdraw consent and tell them how.
- Keep evidence of consent – who, when, how, and what you told people.
- Keep consent under review, and refresh it if anything changes.
- Avoid making consent to processing a precondition of a service.
- Public authorities and employers will need to take extra care to show that consent is freely given, and should avoid over-reliance on consent.
<br>
## 6(1)(b) Contract

You can rely on the contract lawful basis when you need to process someone’s personal data to either carry out a contract with them or to take steps they’ve asked for before entering into a contract.

This basis applies in two situations:

1. When you have a contract with the person and you need to process their data to meet your side of the agreement.
2. When the person has asked you to do something before entering into a contract, such as giving a quote or checking availability, and you need their data to do that.

The key word here is **“necessary.”** If you can carry out the contract without using the data, then this basis doesn’t apply. You can’t use it just because it’s convenient, the processing must be essential to deliver what the contract promises.

You have a lawful basis for processing if: 
- you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data to comply with your obligations under the contract.
- you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data so that they can comply with specific counter-obligations under the contract (eg you are processing payment details).
- you haven’t yet got a contract with the individual, but they have asked you to do something as a first step (eg provide a quote) and you need to process their personal data to do what they ask. This applies even if they don’t actually go on to enter into a contract with you, as long as the processing was in the context of a potential contract with that individual.

Examples:
- An online shop needs a customer’s name and address to deliver their order.
- A letting agency needs a tenant’s details to prepare a tenancy agreement.
- A gym needs a member’s bank details to set up a direct debit for their membership.
In all these cases, the data is needed to provide the service the person has signed up for.

###### What if the contract is with someone else?
You can’t use this basis if the contract is with a third party and not the person whose data you’re processing. In that case, you’ll need to consider a different lawful basis, like a legitimate interests or legal obligation.

###### What about special category data?
If you’re processing sensitive data (like health or biometric data) under this basis, you’ll also need to meet one of the extra conditions under **Article 9**. The contract basis alone isn’t enough for special category data.

###### Do you need to tell people?
Yes. You must explain in your **privacy notice** that you’re relying on the contract basis, and clearly describe what the contract is and why the data is needed.
<br>
## 6(1)(c) Legal Obligation

This lawful basis applies when you need to process personal data to comply with a legal requirement. It must be a real legal obligation, not just something you choose to do or something that’s part of a contract.

###### What does “legal obligation” mean?
It refers to duties set out in UK law, including both statutory law and common law. You don’t need to quote a specific law in every case, but you must be able to point to a clear legal source, like a government website or official guidance, that explains the obligation.

For example:
- Employers must report employee salary details to HMRC.
- Banks must submit Suspicious Activity Reports under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

These are legal duties, not optional actions. If you’re processing data to meet one of these duties, this lawful basis applies.
###### What does “necessary” mean?
The processing must be **essential** to meet the legal obligation. If you can comply with the law without using personal data, then this basis doesn’t apply. You must be able to justify why the data is needed and why there’s no reasonable alternative.

**You can’t use this basis for**:
- Contractual obligations (those fall under Article 6(1)(b)).
- Internal policies or business preferences.
- General good practice unless it’s backed by law.
###### What should you document?
- What the legal obligation is.
- Why the processing is necessary to meet it.
- Where the obligation is set out (e.g. legislation, guidance, or official advice).

You must also explain this basis in your **privacy notice**, so individuals understand why their data is being used and that it’s required by law.
<br>
### 6(1)(d) Vital Interests

This lawful basis applies when you need to process personal data to protect someone’s life. It’s meant for **emergency situations** where the person is unable to give consent, for example, if they’re unconscious or seriously injured.

**Vital interests** are about things that are essential for someone’s survival. This basis is only meant to be used when there’s a **real risk to life** or serious harm, and no other lawful basis is available. It’s not for routine or planned medical care, or for general safety measures.

You can use this basis if:
- The processing is **necessary** to protect someone’s life.
- The person is **physically or legally unable** to give consent.
- There’s **no other less-intrusive way** to protect them.

For example, if someone collapses at work and is unconscious, and you need to share their medical information with emergency services, this would likely fall under vital interests. You can also use this basis to protect someone else’s life, not just the person whose data you’re processing. For instance, you might need to process a parent’s data to protect their child in an emergency.

You can’t use this basis:
- If the person is capable of giving consent, even if they refuse.
- For non-urgent medical care or general health and safety.
- If another lawful basis (like legal obligation or public task) is more appropriate.

If you think you might need to rely on this basis, you should:
- Document the types of situations where it might apply.
- Make sure your staff understand when and how to use it.
- Be ready to explain why it was necessary and why no other basis applied.
<br>
### 6(1)(e) Public Task

This lawful basis applies when you need to process personal data to carry out a task that is in the public interest or part of your official duties and that task must have a clear basis in law.

Public task refers to activities that are either:
- part of your **official authority** (like duties or powers given to you by law), or
- clearly in the **public interest** and backed by law, even if you’re not a public authority.

This basis is most commonly used by **public authorities** such as councils, regulators, or government departments, but it can also apply to other organisations if they’re carrying out legally recognised public functions.

###### What does “laid down by law” mean?
You don’t need a specific law that says “you must process this data,” but the task you’re performing must be clearly supported by law, either through legislation, statutory guidance, or common law duties. You must be able to point to that legal foundation if asked.

###### What does “necessary” mean?
The processing must be **genuinely needed** to carry out the task. If there’s a less intrusive way to do it, or if the task can be done without using personal data, then this basis doesn’t apply.

Examples
- A local authority collecting data to deliver public services.
- A regulator processing complaints or conducting investigations.
- A university processing data for publicly funded research.

You can’t use this basis for:
- Commercial activities that aren’t backed by law.
- Tasks that are optional or not clearly in the public interest.
- Processing that could be done under another lawful basis, like consent or legal obligation, if those are more appropriate.

You should document:
- What the task or function is.
- The legal basis that supports it.
- Why the processing is necessary to carry it out.

You must also explain this basis in your **privacy notice**, so individuals understand why their data is being used and what legal power supports it.
<br>
###  6(1)(f) Legitimate Interests

This lawful basis allows you to process personal data if it’s necessary for your organisation’s legitimate interests or those of a third party as long as those interests aren’t overridden by the individual’s rights and freedoms. It’s the most flexible of the six lawful bases, but it also requires the most careful judgement.

A **legitimate interest** is any real and lawful reason for processing data. It can be commercial (like fraud prevention or direct marketing), organisational (like IT security), or even societal (like public safety). But it must be **genuine**, **specific**, and **lawful**.

You can’t rely on this basis if the processing is unfair, unexpected, or causes harm that outweighs your interest.

To use this basis, you must carry out a **three-part test**:
1. **Purpose test** – Is there a clear and legitimate reason for the processing?
2. **Necessity test** – Is the processing genuinely necessary to achieve that purpose?
3. **Balancing test** – Do the individual’s interests, rights, and freedoms override your interest?

If the answer to all three is yes, then you can rely on legitimate interests, but you must document your reasoning.

**Children’s data** requires extra care. Their rights and expectations carry more weight in the balancing test. If you’re processing data about children, you must be especially cautious and make sure your interests don’t override theirs.

This basis is often used for:
- Preventing fraud or misuse of services
- Network and information security
- Internal administrative purposes
- Direct marketing (within limits)
- Employee monitoring (if proportionate and justified)

It’s not suitable if the person wouldn’t reasonably expect their data to be used that way, or if the impact on them is too great.
###### What should you document?
You should carry out and record a **Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA)**. This shows you’ve thought through the risks and made a fair decision. You must also explain your use of this basis in your **privacy notice**.

***Checklist for legitimate interests:***
	☐ We have checked that legitimate interests is the most appropriate basis.
	☐ We understand our responsibility to protect the individual’s interests.
	☐ We have conducted a legitimate interests assessment (LIA) and kept a record of it, to ensure that we can justify our decision.
	☐ We have identified the relevant legitimate interests.
	☐ We have checked that the processing is necessary and there is no less intrusive way to achieve the same result.
	☐ We have done a balancing test, and are confident that the individual’s interests do not override those legitimate interests.
	☐ We only use individuals’ data in ways they would reasonably expect, unless we have a very good reason.
	☐ We are not using people’s data in ways they would find intrusive or which could cause them harm, unless we have a very good reason.
	☐ If we process children’s data, we take extra care to make sure we protect their interests.
	☐ We have considered safeguards to reduce the impact where possible.
	☐ We have considered whether we can offer an opt out.
	☐ If our LIA identifies a significant privacy impact, we have considered whether we also need to conduct a DPIA.
	☐ We keep our LIA under review, and repeat it if circumstances change.
	☐ We include information about our legitimate interests in our privacy information.

### Special Category Data - Article 9

Special category data is personal data that is more sensitive and needs extra protection. It includes information about:
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership
- Genetic data
- Biometric data (where used for identification)
- Health data
- Sex life or sexual orientation

Because this type of data is more likely to affect someone’s privacy or rights, you can’t process it just by relying on a lawful basis under Article 6. You also need to meet **one of the specific conditions in Article 9(2)**.
<br>
##### Conditions for Processing Special Category Data

You must identify both:
1. A lawful basis under **Article 6**, and
2. A separate condition under **Article 9(2)**.

Here are the main Article 9 conditions:
- **(a) Explicit consent** – The person has clearly agreed to the processing, and the consent is specific, informed, and confirmed in a clear statement.
- **(b) Employment, social security, and social protection law** – The processing is necessary for rights or obligations in employment or social law.
- **(c) Vital interests** – The processing is necessary to protect someone’s life, and they’re unable to give consent.
- **(d) Not-for-profit bodies** – Applies to membership organisations like charities or unions, under strict conditions.
- **(e) Made public by the data subject** – The person has clearly made the data public themselves.
- **(f) Legal claims** – The processing is necessary for legal proceedings or advice.
- **(g) Substantial public interest** – The processing is necessary for reasons clearly in the public interest and supported by law.
- **(h) Health or social care** – The processing is necessary for medical care or treatment.
- **(i) Public health** – The processing is necessary for public health reasons.
- **(j) Archiving, research, or statistics** – The processing is necessary for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes.
Each of these conditions has its own rules and may require safeguards like data minimisation, access controls, or impact assessments.

***Checklist for special category data:***
	☐ We have checked the processing of the special category data is necessary for the purpose we have identified and are satisfied there is no other reasonable and less intrusive way to achieve that purpose.
	☐ We have identified an Article 6 lawful basis for processing the special category data.
	☐ We have identified an appropriate Article 9 condition for processing the special category data.
	☐ Where required, we have also identified an appropriate DPA 2018 Schedule 1 condition.
	☐ We have documented which special categories of data we are processing.
	☐ Where required, we have an [appropriate policy document](https://ico.org.uk/media2/migrated/2616286/appropriate-policy-document.docx) in place.
	☐ We have considered whether we need to do a DPIA.
	☐ We include specific information about our processing of special category data in our privacy information for individuals.
	☐ If we use special category data for automated decision making (including profiling), we have checked we comply with Article 22.
	☐ We have considered whether the risks associated with our use of special category data affect our other obligations around data minimisation, security, and appointing Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and representatives.
<br>
### Criminal Offence Data – Article 10 

Criminal offence data is personal information about criminal convictions, offences, or related security measures. Because this type of data is sensitive, the UK GDPR puts stricter rules around how it can be used.

You can’t process criminal offence data just by picking a lawful basis from Article 6. You also need to meet extra conditions set out in **Article 10** and the **Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)**.

Under Article 10, you can only process criminal offence data if:
- You are doing so **under the control of official authority**, or
- The processing is **authorised by UK law**, and you have **appropriate measures in place to protect people’s rights and freedoms.

“Under the control of official authority” means you are a public body or have legal powers to carry out law enforcement or justice-related tasks. For example, the police, courts, or the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) have this authority.

If you’re not acting under official authority, then you must rely on a specific legal condition from **Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018**. These conditions are similar to those for special category data and include things like employment law, safeguarding, legal claims, or substantial public interest.

You must also have **appropriate policy documents** in place. These documents explain why you’re processing the data, how long you’ll keep it, and what safeguards you’ve put in place to protect it.

If you’re keeping a **comprehensive register of criminal convictions**, that register must be under the control of official authority. This means only certain public bodies can maintain such registers, private organisations can’t do this unless they’re acting on behalf of a public authority and under its strict control.

Because of the risks involved, processing criminal offence data may also trigger other requirements. You might need to carry out a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**, keep detailed records, and involve your **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**.

In short, criminal offence data is highly restricted. You need a lawful basis under Article 6, plus either official authority or a legal condition under the DPA 2018, along with strong measures and documentation.

***Checklist for criminal offence data:***
	☐ We have checked that the processing of the criminal offence data is necessary for the purpose we have identified and are satisfied there is no other reasonable and less intrusive way to achieve this purpose.
	☐ We have identified an Article 6 lawful basis for processing the criminal offence data.
	☐ Where applicable, we have identified in law our official authority to process the criminal offence data.
	☐ Where we do not have official authority to process criminal offence data, we have identified an appropriate DPA 2018 Schedule 1 condition.
	☐ Where required, we have an [appropriate policy document](https://ico.org.uk/media2/migrated/2616286/appropriate-policy-document.docx "appropriate-policy-document").
	☐ We have considered whether we need to do a DPIA.
	☐ We include specific information about our processing of criminal offence data in our privacy information for individuals.
	☐ We have considered whether the risks associated with our use of criminal offence data affect our other obligations around data minimisation, security, and appointing Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and representatives.
