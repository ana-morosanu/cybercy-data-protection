Article 5 of the UK GDPR establishes the foundational principles that govern the processing of personal data. These principles are legally binding and must be adhered to by all data controllers and processors. They serve as the framework for ensuring that personal data is handled responsibly and ethically.

## Sections 5(1) - The Six Core Principles
#### 5(1)(a). Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency

**Lawfulness** - we can’t just collect or use someone’s personal data because we feel like it, we need a proper reason that the law allows. The UK GDPR gives us six legal reasons (called “lawful bases”) for using personal data. These include things like getting the person’s consent, needing the data to carry out a contract, or having a legal duty to use it.

Before we collect any data, we need to be clear about which lawful basis applies and make sure we’ve documented it. If we’re dealing with sensitive data, like health information or details about someone’s beliefs, there are extra rules we need to follow.

It’s also important that we don’t break any other laws while using the data. For example, we still have to respect confidentiality and human rights laws.

Checklist for lawfulness:
	☐ We have identified an appropriate lawful basis (or bases) for our processing.
	☐ If we are processing special category data or criminal offence data, we have identified a condition for processing this type of data.
	☐ We don’t do anything generally unlawful with personal data.

**Fairness** is about treating people in a way they’d expect and not doing anything with their data that could surprise or harm them. If we collect someone’s data for one reason, we shouldn’t secretly use it for something else. And we shouldn’t collect more data than we actually need.

We also need to think about how our actions affect people. Could using their data in a certain way cause them stress or confusion? If so, we need to rethink what we’re doing. Being fair means being honest and respectful. It’s about doing the right thing, not just ticking boxes.

Checklist for fairness:
	☐ We have considered how the processing may affect the individuals concerned and can justify any adverse impact.
	☐ We only handle people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect, or we can explain why any unexpected processing is justified.
	☐ We do not deceive or mislead people when we collect their personal data.

**Transparency** means being open and clear with people about what we’re doing with their data. We should explain things in plain language and make sure people can easily find this information, usually in a privacy notice. We need to tell people things like:

- Why we’re collecting their data
- What we’re going to do with it
- Who we might share it with
- How long we’ll keep it
- What rights they have 

If we’re collecting data directly from someone, we should tell them this information straight away. If we get it from somewhere else, we need to let them know within a reasonable time.

Being transparent helps build trust. When people understand what’s happening with their data, they’re more likely to feel comfortable and confident in how we handle it.

Checklist for transparency
	☐ We are open and honest, and comply with the transparency obligations of the right to be informed.

#### 5(1)(b). Purpose Limitation

This principle is about being honest and specific about why we're collecting someone's personal data and making sure we don't use it for anything else unless we have a good reason. It's about setting clear boundaries from the start and sticking to them.

When we collect personal data, we need to be clear about what we're going to use it for. That purpose needs to be specific, easy to understand and lawful. We should write it down in our internal records and explain it to the person whose data we're collecting, usually in a privacy notice. This helps everyone understand what's going on and avoids confusion or misuse later on. 

Once we've collected the data, we can't just decide to use it for something completely different. If we do want to use it for a new purpose, we need to check whether that new use is similar enough to the original one that so the person wouldn't be surprised. If it's not, we'll need to either get their permission or have a clear legal reason for the change.

This principle is also about avoiding "function creep". That's when data starts being used for more and more things over time, often without anyone really noticing. It might seem harmless at first, but it can lead to people losing trust in how we handle their information. Being clear and consistent about our purpose helps prevent that.

There are some exception to this rule. For example, if we're using data for scientific research, historical records, or statistics, the law says that can be ok as long as we have proper safeguards in place and we're not using the data in a way that could harm or identify people unnecessarily. To sum it up, purpose limitation is about being respectful and responsible. It's about collecting data for a reason, being open about that reason and not changing the rules halfway through without a good explanation.

Checklist for purpose limitation:
	☐ We have clearly identified our purpose or purposes for processing.
	☐ We have documented those purposes.
	☐ We include details of our purposes in our privacy information for individuals.
	☐ We regularly review our processing and, where necessary, update our documentation and our privacy information for individuals.
	☐ If we plan to use personal data for a new purpose other than a legal obligation or function set out in law, we check that this is compatible with our original purpose or we get specific consent for the new purpose.

#### 5(1)(c). Data Minimisation

This principle is about making sure we only collet and keep the personal data we actually need, nothing more, nothing less. It's about being sensible and respectful with people's information.

When we collect personal data, we should already know what we're going to use it for. Once we're clear on that, we need to ask ourselves: "What's the minimum amount of information we need in order to do this properly?" That's all we should collect. If we don't need it, we shouldn't ask for it. If we already have it and it's not useful anymore, we should delete it.

The law says the data we collect must be adequate, relevant and limited to what's necessary. That means the data should be enough to do the job properly, it should relate directly to the task at hand, and we shouldn't be holding on to extra details just in case we might need them one day.

This isn't about efficiency but rather protecting people's privacy. The more data we collect, the more we have to protect and the greater the risk if something goes wrong. By sticking to only what's needed, we reduce that risk and show that we're taking data protection seriously.

It’s also important to regularly check the data we already hold. If we find anything that’s no longer needed, or that doesn’t really serve a purpose anymore, we should get rid of it. This helps keep our records clean and up to date, and it shows we’re being responsible.

There are also rights tied to this principle. For example, if someone sees that we’re holding unnecessary or incomplete data about them, they can ask us to fix it or delete it. That’s part of their right to rectification and their right to erasure.

In short, data minimisation is about being thoughtful. We collect what we need, we use it for the right reasons, and we don’t keep anything extra just because we can.

#### 5(1)(d). Accuracy

This principle is about making sure the personal data we hold is correct, clear, and up to date especially when we’re using it to make decisions about people. If we’re working with information that’s wrong or misleading, it can cause real problems for the people it’s about, and it can damage trust in how we handle data.

The law says that personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. That means we need to take reasonable steps to check that the data we collect or use is right for the purpose we’re using it for. If we find out that something is wrong, we need to fix it or delete it as soon as possible.

Accuracy doesn’t always mean the data has to be perfect, it just has to be correct in the context we’re using it. For example, if someone gave us their address last year and we’re using it to send them a letter today, we should check whether they’ve moved since then. But if we’re keeping a record of what their address was at that time, and we clearly label it as a past address, that’s still accurate.

We also need to be careful with opinions. If we’re recording someone’s opinion like in a performance review, we should make it clear that it’s an opinion, not a fact. And if the facts behind that opinion change, we should update the record.

If someone tells us their data is wrong, we have to take that seriously. They have the right to ask us to correct it, and we need to look into it properly. If we agree it’s wrong, we fix it. If we don’t agree, we should still make a note that they challenged it and explain why we think the data is accurate.

Keeping data accurate is an ongoing job. It’s not enough to check it once and forget about it. We need to think about how often the data might change and whether we need to update it regularly. This is especially important for things like contact details, health information, or anything we use to make decisions that affect people.

In short, accuracy is about being careful, respectful, and responsible. It helps us avoid mistakes, protect people’s rights, and make sure we’re using data in a way that’s fair and trustworthy.

Checklist for accuracy:
	☐ We ensure the accuracy of any personal data we create.
	☐ We have appropriate processes in place to check the accuracy of the data we collect, and we record the source of that data.
	☐ We have a process in place to identify when we need to keep the data updated to properly fulfil our purpose, and we update it as necessary.
	☐ If we need to keep a record of a mistake, we clearly identify it as a mistake.
	☐ Our records clearly identify any matters of opinion, and where appropriate whose opinion it is and any relevant changes to the underlying facts.
	☐ We comply with the individual’s right to rectification and carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of the personal data.
	☐ As a matter of good practice, we keep a note of any challenges to the accuracy of the personal data.

#### 5(1)(e). Storage Limitation

This principle is about not keeping personal data for longer than we actually need it. Just because we’ve collected someone’s information doesn’t mean we can hold onto it forever. We need to be clear about how long we’re going to keep it and we need to be able to explain why.

The idea is simple: once we’ve finished using the data for the reason we collected it, we should either delete it or anonymise it so it can’t be linked back to the person. Holding onto data “just in case” isn’t a good enough reason. We need to think carefully about what’s appropriate and fair.

To help with this, we should have a retention policy which is a document that sets out how long we keep different types of data and what happens when that time is up. This helps us stay consistent and makes it easier to manage our records. It also shows that we’re taking our responsibilities seriously.

We should regularly review the data we hold to check whether we still need it. If we find something that’s no longer needed, we should securely delete it or anonymise it. This is especially important for things like old contact details, outdated records, or information about people who no longer use our services.

People also have the right to ask us to delete their data if we no longer need it. This is part of their “right to be forgotten.” If someone makes that request and we can’t justify keeping their data, we need to remove it.

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, we’re allowed to keep data for longer if we’re using it for public interest archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes but only if we’ve put proper safeguards in place to protect people’s rights.

In short, storage limitation is about being organised, respectful, and mindful of people’s privacy. It’s about showing that we’re using data responsibly and not holding onto it longer than necessary.

Checklist for storage limitation:
	☐ We know what personal data we hold and why we need it.
	☐ We carefully consider and can justify how long we keep personal data.
	☐ We have a policy with standard retention periods where possible, in line with documentation obligations.
	☐ We regularly review our information and erase or anonymise personal data when we no longer need it.
	☐ We have appropriate processes in place to comply with individuals’ requests for erasure under ‘the right to be forgotten’.
	☐ We clearly identify any personal data that we need to keep for public interest archiving, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes.

A big part of following the storage limitation principle is having a clear plan for how long we keep personal data, and what we do with it when we no longer need it. That’s where a **retention policy** and a **retention schedule** come in.

A retention policy is a simple plan that explains how long we keep different types of personal data and what we do with it when we no longer need it. It helps us stay organised and ensures we’re not holding onto data longer than necessary.

The retention schedule is the detailed part of that plan. It lists each type of record, like HR files, finance documents, or customer data and shows how long we should keep it. It also says what to do when that time is up, like deleting or anonymising the data.

#### 5(1)(f). Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)

This principle is about making sure personal data is kept safe, accurate, and protected from anything that could damage it or put it in the wrong hands. It’s often called the “security principle” because it focuses on how we protect the data we hold.

We’re responsible for putting the right security measures in place to protect personal data from being accidentally lost, changed, destroyed, or accessed by someone who shouldn’t see it. This applies whether the data is stored digitally or on paper.

Security isn’t just about having strong passwords or antivirus software, although those are important. It also includes how we train staff, how we control access to systems and files, and how we manage risks. For example, we should make sure only the right people can access certain types of data, and that we have clear procedures for handling it safely.

The level of security we need depends on the type of data we’re dealing with. More sensitive data, like health records or financial details needs stronger protection. But even basic information like names and addresses should be handled with care.

We also need to think about what could go wrong. That means carrying out risk assessments to identify possible threats, like cyberattacks, human error, or physical theft. Once we understand the risks, we can put the right controls in place to reduce them.

It’s not enough to set up security once and forget about it. We need to regularly review and update our systems, especially as technology and threats change. We should also have a plan in place for what to do if something goes wrong, like a data breach so we can act quickly and limit the damage.

If a breach does happen and it’s serious enough to risk people’s rights or freedoms, we may need to report it to the ICO within 72 hours. In some cases, we’ll also need to tell the people affected.

In short, this principle is about being proactive and responsible. It’s about making sure personal data stays safe, and that we’re always thinking ahead to prevent problems before they happen.

## Section 5(2) - Accountability

Accountability means we’re not only expected to follow data protection rules, we also have to show that we’re doing it. It’s about taking full responsibility for how we handle personal data.

To meet this principle, we need to have the right policies, procedures, and records in place. That includes keeping a Record of Processing Activities (ROPA), completing Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) when needed, and making sure staff are trained and aware of their responsibilities.

We also need to build data protection into everything we do, from the way we design systems to how we manage risks. This is called “data protection by design and by default.”

Being accountable means regularly reviewing what we’re doing, updating our practices when things change, and being ready to explain our decisions if asked. It’s not just about compliance, it’s about building trust and showing we take data protection seriously.
