### What is the GDPR and Why Does It Matter?

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a law that sets rules for how organisations must handle personal data. It applies not only to companies in the UK and EU but also to any business that deals with the personal data of UK or EU residents. The goal is to protect people’s privacy and give them more control over how their data is used.

By being compliant with the regulation's requirements, businesses can build trust with their customers and stakeholders, which enhances their reputation and competitiveness in the market. This shows their commitment to data protection and the ability to easily mitigate the risk of facing severe fines and penalties.

### What Happens If You Don’t Follow the Rules?

If an organisation breaks the GDPR rules, it can face serious consequences. These include **large fines**, **orders to stop processing data**, and even **audits** by regulators. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is responsible for enforcing these rules.

There are **two main levels of fines**, depending on how serious the breach is:

##### 1. Lower-Level Fines (Up to €10 million or 2% of global turnover, so 2% of what the company makes in that year)

These apply to less serious issues, such as:

- Not getting proper consent from children.
- Failing to meet basic responsibilities as a data controller or processor.
- Not cooperating with certification bodies or regulators.
- Ignoring orders from supervisory authorities.


The GDPR articles corresponding with the less serious issues listed above:

- **Article 8** – Conditions applicable to child’s consent in relation to information society services
- **Article 11** – Processing which does not require identification
- **Articles 25-39** – General obligations of controllers and processors
- **Article 42** – Certification
- **Article 43** – Certification bodies

##### 2. Higher-Level Fines (Up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, so 4% of what that company made in a year which can be higher than 20 mil)

These are for more serious violations, including:

- Breaking the core principles of data protection (like fairness, transparency, and security).
- Violating people’s rights over their data (such as the right to access or delete their data).
- Transferring data to other countries without proper safeguards.


The GDPR articles corresponding with the more serious issues listed above:

- **Article 5** – Principles relating to processing of personal data
- **Article 6** – Lawfulness of processing
- **Article 7** – Conditions for consent
- **Article 9** – Processing of special categories of personal data
- **Articles 12-22** – Rights of the data subject
- **Articles 44-49** – Transfers of data to third countries or international organizations


The actual fine depends on several factors, including:

- How serious the breach was.
- Whether it was intentional or due to negligence.
- How many people were affected.
- Whether the organisation tried to fix the issue quickly.
- If the company has a history of similar problems.

#### Other Penalties and Powers

Fines aren’t the only tool regulators have. They can also:

- Order a company to stop processing certain data.
- Require changes to how data is handled.
- Conduct audits or investigations.
- Issue public warnings or reprimands.

#### Why Compliance is Important

Following the GDPR isn’t just about avoiding fines. It also helps build trust with customers, protects your reputation, and shows that your organisation takes data privacy seriously. In today’s digital world, that can be a big competitive advantage.
