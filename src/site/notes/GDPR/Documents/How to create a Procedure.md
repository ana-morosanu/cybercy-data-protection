### **Step 1: Know What You’re Writing — Procedure vs Policy**

Before you start, you need to be 100% clear on what a **procedure** is — and what it isn’t.

A **procedure** is a set of instructions. It tells someone exactly how to do something. It’s practical, detailed, and action-based. It’s like a recipe: it explains what to do, in what order, using what tools, and who is responsible.

Sometimes procedures can be confused with policies. A **policy** is a set of rules or principles. It explains what your organisation believes or requires. It might say what must happen, or what is allowed or not allowed, but it doesn’t explain how to do it.

If you’re writing about values, rules, or legal obligations without explaining how to carry them out, you’re writing a **policy**.

If you’re explaining how to do something, step by step, you’re writing a **procedure**.

### **Step 2: Choose ONLY One Task**

A procedure should focus on one specific task or process. Don’t try to cover multiple things in one document. If you try to explain too much at once, the document will become confusing and hard to follow.

Pick one task that someone in the organisation needs to do. It could be something they do regularly, or something they only do occasionally but need to get right. The task should have a clear beginning and end.

If you’re not sure whether something is a task or a policy topic, ask yourself: “Can I break this down into steps someone would follow?” If the answer is yes, it’s a task and you can write a procedure for it.



### **Step 3: Find Out How the Task Is Actually Done**

You can’t write a good procedure unless you understand how the task works in real life. That means you need to do some research.

If you already do the task yourself, think through each step carefully. If someone else does it, talk to them. Ask them to walk you through it. Watch them do it if you can. Take notes.

Ask questions like:

- What triggers this task? When does it start?
- What’s the first thing you do?
- What happens next?
- What tools, systems, or documents do you use?
- Who else is involved?
- What could go wrong?
- What do you do if something unexpected happens?

Don’t assume anything is obvious. Write everything down.

Moreover, search up online examples of other policies used by companies similar to the one you are going to write the policy for. It will help you grasp the layout and the concept much easier. 



### **Step 4: Give the Procedure a Clear, Direct Title**

The title should say exactly what the procedure is about. Keep it short and specific. Avoid vague or general titles.

A good title starts with “How to…” or “Procedure for…” followed by the task.

This helps people find the right document quickly and understand what it’s for.



### **Step 5: Write a Short Introduction**

Start the document with a short paragraph that explains:

- What the procedure is for
- Why it matters
- Who should follow it

This helps the reader understand the purpose of the document and whether it applies to them.

Keep it simple and to the point. Don’t include rules or legal references here, **that belongs in a policy**.



### **Step 6: Define Any Unfamiliar Terms**

If your procedure uses any terms that might be unfamiliar, like acronyms, system names, or technical language, explain them near the top of the document.

You don’t need to define everyday words. Just explain anything that someone new might not understand.

This makes the procedure easier to follow and avoids confusion.



### **Step 7: Write the Steps Clearly and in Order**

This is the core of the procedure where you’re going to explain how to do the task, step by step.

Start with what triggers the task, what causes someone to begin. Then explain what to do next, and what happens after that. Keep going until the task is complete.

For each step:

- Use plain English.
- Keep sentences short and clear.
- Say exactly what to do.
- Say who is responsible.
- Mention any tools, systems, or documents they need.
- Include any time limits or deadlines.
- Say what to do if something goes wrong.

Don’t skip steps. Don’t assume the reader knows what to do. Imagine you’re explaining it to someone who’s never done it before.

If the task has different paths (for example, “if X happens, do this; if Y happens, do that”), explain each one clearly.



### **Step 8: List Any Tools, Templates, or Documents**

If the person needs to use a form, template, checklist, or system to complete the task, tell them exactly what it is and where to find it.

Don’t just say “use the form.” Say what the form is called and where it’s saved. If it’s on a shared drive or system, give the file path or link.

This helps people follow the procedure without getting stuck.



### **Step 9: Add a Version History**

At the end of the document, include a small table that shows:

- The version number
- The date it was created or updated
- What changed
- Who made the change

This helps people know if they’re using the latest version and shows how the procedure has evolved.



### **Step 10: Save and Share the Procedure##

Once the procedure is finished, save it in the correct place. Use a clear file name that includes the word “Procedure,” the task name, and the version number.

Make sure it’s stored in the official folder where procedures are kept, and that the right people know it exists.

If needed, provide a short explanation or training session to help people understand how to use it.



### **Step 11: Review It Regularly**

Procedures need to be kept up to date. Set a reminder to review each one at least once a year, or sooner if the task changes.

When you update a procedure, change the version number and update the version history table.


And finally, don't forget to check with the DPO to check everything is correct!
