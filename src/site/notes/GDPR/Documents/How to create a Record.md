This guide explains how to create a **record**, a written entry that captures something important that happened, was done, or was decided. Records are used to show that your organisation is doing things properly, especially when it comes to data protection. They help you prove that you followed the right steps, made the right decisions, and kept track of important events.

### Step 1: Know What You’re Recording

Before you start writing, be clear about what the record is for, answer the following questions:
- What happened or what was done?
- Why does it need to be recorded?
- Who was involved?
- When did it happen?

You’re not writing a story or a report. You’re just capturing the facts.

### Step 2: Use the Right Format

Your organisation might already have a template or register for this kind of record. If so, use it. If not, you can create a simple document or spreadsheet (highly likely that you'll use Excel) with the following basic structure:

- Date of the record
- What the record is about
- Who created the record
- Details of what happened
- Any actions taken
- Any documents or evidence attached
- Who reviewed or approved it (if needed)


### Step 4: Attach or Link to Any Supporting Documents

If there are any emails, forms, screenshots, or other documents that support the record, attach them or link to where they’re stored. This helps show that the record is accurate and complete.

If you’re writing in a shared register, you can just write something like:  
“See attached email dated 12/06/2025” or “See folder: Shared Drive > Data Protection > SARs > 2025-06-12”

## Step 5: Save the Record in the Right Place

Once the record is written, save it in the correct location. This might be:

- A shared folder
- A central register (like a spreadsheet)
- A case file
- A document management system

Make sure it’s saved with a clear name and in the right format. If there’s a naming convention (like “Record - [Topic] - [Date]”), follow it.

## Step 6: Let the Right People Know (If Needed)

If the record needs to be reviewed, approved, or shared with someone (like the DPO or a manager), send it to them or notify them that it’s been created.

---

## Step 7: Keep It Up to Date (If Ongoing)

If the situation is still developing (for example, an ongoing investigation or request), update the record as things progress. Add new entries with the date and what happened.

Don’t delete or overwrite old information — just add to it.
