This international standard provides a framework for organisations to manage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly. It helps organisations that develop, provide, or use AI systems to ensure these systems are safe, trustworthy, and aligned with legal and ethical expectations.

The standard is designed for all types of organisations, regardless of size or sector. It can be used by companies that build AI systems, use them in their operations, or offer AI-based services.

The core idea is to create an AI management system that fits into the organisationâ€™s existing structure. This system should help manage risks, ensure compliance, and support responsible innovation.

### **Key Concepts**

The standard encourages organisations to understand their internal and external environment. This includes legal requirements, ethical concerns, and the expectations of customers, regulators, and other stakeholders. It also asks organisations to clearly define their role in the AI ecosystem, whether they are developers, users, or partners.

Leadership plays a central role. Top management must show commitment by setting policies, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring the AI management system is integrated into business processes.

Planning is essential. Organisations must identify risks and opportunities related to AI, set clear objectives, and plan how to achieve them. This includes conducting risk assessments and impact assessments to understand how AI systems might affect people and society.

Support involves making sure the right resources, skills, and awareness are in place. Communication and documentation are also important so that everyone involved understands their responsibilities and how the system works.

Operations must be controlled and monitored. This includes managing changes, ensuring AI systems are used as intended, and keeping records of decisions and actions.

Performance must be evaluated regularly. Internal audits and management reviews help ensure the system is working and improving over time.

When problems occur, organisations must take corrective action and learn from mistakes. Continuous improvement is a key part of the standard.

### **Controls and Guidance**

The standard includes a detailed list of controls in Annex A, with guidance in Annex B. These cover areas like:
- Creating and reviewing AI policies
- Defining roles and responsibilities
- Managing data quality and system documentation
- Assessing the impact of AI on individuals and society
- Ensuring responsible use and human oversight
- Managing relationships with suppliers and customers

Organisations are expected to choose the controls that are relevant to them and explain why they are using or not using each one.

### **Integration with Other Standards**

ISO/IEC 42001 is designed to work alongside other management system standards like ISO 9001 (quality), ISO/IEC 27001 (information security), and ISO/IEC 27701 (privacy). This makes it easier for organisations to manage AI risks in a way that aligns with their existing compliance and governance frameworks.
